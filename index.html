			 <h1 class="display-4">Why RISE ABOVE Tutorials?</h1>
			 <h2 class="lead">Our Value System</h2>
			 <p>Rise Above Tutorials value system revolves around truth, transparency & commitment.<br>
				Whatever we think, we say & whatever we say, we do. We present to you what we actually are.</p>
			 <h2 class="lead">Our Quality</h2>
			 <p>We never compromise on quality.<br>
			   Our penchant & pursuit of quality is evident in our every activity, in all our actions, at all times, everywhere.</p>
			 <h2 class="lead">Best Faculty</h2>
			 <p>Every institute for IIT-JEE training worth its name tries to get a Rise Above faculty. We are the only institute that follows a very<br>
				strong, systematic & objective selection and training process before a teacher becomes a Rise Above faculty. Rise Above has a pool<br>
				of more than 1800 very competent full-time faculty ensuring you get highly effective teachers in all the subjects throughout your studies.</p>
			 <h2 class="lead">Pattern Proof Teaching Methodology</h2>
			 <p>Rise Above Tutorials has always been preparing Students in a fundamental way. It has been teaching in a comprehensive way so<br>
				  that students do well in IIT-JEE (irrespective of the pattern), Boards, NTSE, KVPY, Olympiads and Other Engineering Entrance Exams.<br>
				  For the last many years our students have been securing admissions in the top 10 US Universities where admission<br>
				  is based on the performance of school + Last Board Exam and SAT-I, SAT-II, AP Exams & TOEFL. Testing pattern of IIT-JEE<br>
				  keeps on changing but the key aspect of the test is to judge the analytical ability of the aspirants along with the<br>
				  understanding of fundamentals. students having sound understanding of fundamental concepts & practising varied types<br>
				  of problems persistently will always outperform those Students, who confine their preparation to the pattern only rather<br>
				  than understanding the concepts.</p>
